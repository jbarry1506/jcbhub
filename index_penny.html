                        Welcome to year two of the WildBarry Halloween Party!!!<br>
                        This year we've decided to have a little more scary fun with clowns, lol.  As you can see, there are
                        pictures being changed up periodically.  <br>This is happening through a series of events triggered from
                        a simple button push.  The button kicks off a blast of cold air from a leafblower (held by the clown you see
                        above), lights up a creepy clown with glowing eyes, triggers a scream, and takes a little snapshot to remember the occasion.
                        Then, the picture gets pushed to source control.<br>
                        I have a jenkins server that is polling my repository every minute for changes.  If there is a change, 
                        this website is rebuilt.  The pictures are being stored, so if you want to see the silly face you made, just ask, lol. <br>
                        LOVE YOU GUYS!!!  Happy Halloween!!!
